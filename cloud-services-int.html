	     as they provide numerous services such as the ability to access your information from anywhere in the world. One of the most beneficial things that cloud services offer is the ability to

	     <div class="section" id="section3">Some Interesting Facts About Cloud Services</div>
	     <div class="section" id="section4"><p class="piling-paragraph">There are four main types of cloud services which are: Software as a Service (SaaS) - Salesforce, Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Cloud 9, 
	     Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Amazon and also Communication as a Service (CaaS) - Gmail.
	     <br/>
	     <br/>
	     Cloud Services are used by millions of people daily to store data, purchase goods and also as a means of communication.
	     <br/>
	     <br/>
